# AI-Powered-Image-to-Art-Generator
Turn ordinary photos into stunning works of art with AI!
This project applies Neural Style Transfer and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform images into unique artistic styles such as oil painting, sketch, cartoon, or abstract art.
🚀 Features
✅ Upload any image and generate artwork instantly
✅ Multiple pre-trained artistic styles
✅ High-resolution output
✅ Web-based interface (Flask / Streamlit / Gradio)
✅ Lightweight & deployable on Hugging Face / Heroku / AWS

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy
Models: Neural Style Transfer, GANs
Frontend/UI: Streamlit / Flask / Gradio
Deployment: Docker, Hugging Face Spaces, Heroku, AWS
